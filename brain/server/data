My mind is always calculte future risk, money, family expectation, and social compare.

  "enhancedText": "Burnout occurs from continuous learning without breaks, causing guilt when stopping and exhaustion when continuing. Constant thoughts about future risks, financial concerns, family expectations, and social comparisons contribute to stress. The pressure to achieve fast success and the influence of hustle culture undermine confidence. A slower, more logical approach to growth is desired, but external pressures make this difficult.",
