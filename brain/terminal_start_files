  "prompt": "I am reaching a point where I feel deeply confused about my career direction. I have learned many skills over the years, some technical, some general, but none of them feel like a stable foundation. I constantly compare my progress with others who seem settled, and that comparison makes me doubt every decision I make. I want to understand how an experienced person thinks when choosing one path without constantly fearing that they are making the wrong choice."
